# ODIN-23 Summary

A white paper summarizing the ODIN 2023 symposium and its discussions.

# For authors

## Why GitHub?

Google Docs or similar platforms is certainly easier to use for rapid collaboration among a small number of writers, but managing minor suggestions, ensuing discussions, and precise versioning can all be quite a hassle at a larger scale: these are exactly the conditions GitHub is built to handle.

It also allows us to treat the endeavor more like a scientific project; bundling all the notes collected from individuals, leaving an open persistent record of conversations and perspectives that live on top of external links to the raw video recordings of the proceedings.

If there are any annoyances experienced over time due to this choice, raise an issue so we can discuss solutions.



## Guiding principles

Try to be as concise as possible with this paper; a lot happened and it would take a lot of text space to describe everything in detail

A big point to the release of this paper is the transparency it will afford to what was otherwise a fairly tight-knit conference that will no doubt receive ongoing attention from the community (based on how quickly the signups for the event filled up)

Up until the technical discussions of the third day, attempt to minimize specific references to the DANDI archive; it is no secret that the DANDI team organized the conference, and slight preference was given to selecting speakers that have high-profile dandisets, but the conference itself was not intended as a direct advertisement of the archive; rather it indirectly showed all the great science that could be enabled if open data sharing as a guiding principle was more prominent in our field

The technical discussions from the last day inevitably became questions of how to make the archive better, so making that the focus of the last section is fine; also using this as an opportunity to publicize the DANDI roadmap a bit more explicitly would be great
