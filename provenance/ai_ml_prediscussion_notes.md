This is a collection of notes from Cody Baker and Guillame Viejo prior to leading the discussion section on the third day of ODIN 2023.


# Strategy


- Motivate with a brief intro on data lifecycle and intro, then go around the room to introduce themselves to break the ice

- Emphasize the difference between computation and visualization w.r.t. Pynapple, widgets, neurosift, etc.

- Computations only as fast as infrastructure/format allows

- Mention the current state of LLMs: AmadeusGPT, BrainGPT, ontology recommender service

# Specific questions

- LLMs right now are tools to write code; should we trust the scientific community to use these to analyze data, such as ‘compute correlogram’; should we trust blackbox approach??

- Can student rely on AI tools or should they go to the hard path of learning numerical computation when starting their Ph.D.? [with respect to alternatives such as simple API such as pynapple or having a data engineer on staff to explain it quickly] Is it worth their time [of a PhD student or postdoc] to spend on this problem?

- A lot of labs students are not trained in computer science and might trust it blindly
